                                    <p><strong>DATA PROTECTION</strong></p>
                                    <p>By submitting a manuscript to or reviewing for this publication, your name, email address, and affiliation, and other contact details the publication might require, will be used for the regular operations of the publication, including, when necessary, sharing with the publisher (Wiley) and partners for production and publication. The publication and the publisher recognize the importance of protecting the personal information collected from users in the operation of these services, and have practices in place to ensure that steps are taken to maintain the security, integrity, and privacy of the personal data collected and processed. You can learn more at: https://authorservices.wiley.com/statements/data-protection-policy.html.</p>
                                    <p><strong><br/>PREPRINT POLICY </strong></p>
                                    <p>Wiley believes that journals publishing for communities with established pre-print servers should allow authors to submit manuscripts which have already been made available on a non-commercial preprint server. Allowing submission does not, of course, guarantee that an article will be sent out for review. It simply reflects our belief that journals should not rule out reviewing a paper simply because it has already been available on a non-commercial server. Please see below for the specific policy language.</p>
                                    <p>However, Wiley also knows that the use of preprint servers is not universally accepted and that individual journals and/or societies may approach submission of preprints differently.</p>
                                    <p><em>This journal will consider for review articles previously available as preprints on non-commercial servers such as ArXiv, bioRxiv, psyArXiv, SocArXiv, engrXiv, etc. Authors may also post the submitted version of a manuscript to non-commercial servers at any time. Authors are requested to update any pre-publication versions with a link to the final published article. </em></p>

                                    <p>  2. AIMS AND SCOPE</p>
                                    <p>Network problems are pervasive in our modern technological society, as witnessed by our reliance on physical networks that provide power, communication, and transportation. As well, a number of processes can be modeled using logical networks, as in the scheduling of interdependent tasks, the dating of archaeological artifacts, or the compilation of subroutines comprising a large computer program. Networks provide a common framework for posing and studying problems that often have wider applicability than their originating context.<br/><br/>The goal of this journal is to provide a central forum for the distribution of timely information about network problems, their design and mathematical analysis, as well as efficient algorithms for carrying out optimization on networks. The nonstandard modeling of diverse processes using networks and network concepts is also of interest. Consequently, the disciplines that are useful in studying networks are varied, including applied mathematics, operations research, computer science, discrete mathematics, and economics.<br/><br/><em>Networks</em> publishes material on the analytic modeling of problems using networks, the mathematical analysis of network problems, the design of computationally efficient network algorithms, and innovative case studies of successful network applications. We do not typically publish works that fall in the realm of pure graph theory (without significant algorithmic and modeling contributions) or papers that deal with engineering aspects of network design. Since the audience for this journal is then necessarily broad, articles that impact multiple application areas or that creatively use new or existing methodologies are especially appropriate. We seek to publish original, well-written research papers that make a substantive contribution to the knowledge base. In addition, tutorial and survey articles are welcomed. All manuscripts are carefully refereed.</p>

                                        <li>Your manuscript: this should be a PDF file including text, figures, and tables. Should your manuscript reach the final revision stage figures and tables must be provided as separate files. All required sections should be contained in your manuscript, including abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusions. Figures and tables should have legends. Figures should be uploaded in the highest resolution possible. References may be submitted in any style or format, as long as it is consistent throughout the manuscript. Supporting information should be submitted in separate files. If the manuscript, figures or tables are difficult for you to read, they will also be difficult for the editors and reviewers, and the editorial office will send it back to you for revision. Your manuscript may also be sent back to you for revision if the quality of English language is poor.

                                    <p><strong>Peer Review and Acceptance</strong></p>
                                    <p>The acceptance criteria for all papers are the quality and originality of the research and its significance to journal readership. Papers will only be sent to review if the Editor-in-Chief determines that the paper meets the appropriate quality and relevance requirements. </p>
                                    <p>Wiley's policy on the confidentiality of the review process is <a href="http://www.wileypeerreview.com/reviewpolicy">available here.</a></p>
                                    <p><strong>Conflict of Interest</strong></p>
                                    <p>The journal requires that all authors disclose any potential sources of conflict of interest. Any interest or relationship, financial or otherwise that might be perceived as influencing an author's objectivity is considered a potential source of conflict of interest. These must be disclosed when directly relevant or directly related to the work that the authors describe in their manuscript. Potential sources of conflict of interest include, but are not limited to: patent or stock ownership, membership of a company board of directors, membership of an advisory board or committee for a company, and consultancy for or receipt of speaker's fees from a company. The existence of a conflict of interest does not preclude publication. If the authors have no conflict of interest to declare, they must also state this at submission. It is the responsibility of the corresponding author to review this policy with all authors and collectively to disclose with the submission ALL pertinent commercial and other relationships.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Funding</strong></p>
                                    <p>Authors should list all funding sources in the Acknowledgments section. Authors are responsible for the accuracy of their funder designation. If in doubt, please check the Open Funder Registry for the correct nomenclature: <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/">https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/</a></p>
                                    <p><strong>Authorship</strong></p>
                                    <p>The list of authors should accurately illustrate who contributed to the work and how. All those listed as authors should qualify for authorship according to the following criteria:</p>
                                    <p>1. Have made substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; and <br/>2. Been involved in drafting the manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and <br/>3. Given final approval of the version to be published. Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content; and <br/>4. Agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.<br/>Contributions from anyone who does not meet the criteria for authorship should be listed, with permission from the contributor, in an Acknowledgments section (for example, to recognize contributions from people who provided technical help, collation of data, writing assistance, acquisition of funding, or a department chairperson who provided general support). Prior to submitting the article all authors should agree on the order in which their names will be listed in the manuscript.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Additional Authorship Options</strong> </p>
                                    <p>Joint first or senior authorship: In the case of joint first authorship, a footnote should be added to the author listing, e.g. ‘X and Y should be considered joint first author’ or ‘X and Y should be considered joint senior author.’</p>
                                    <p><strong>Data Sharing and Data Accessibility</strong></p>
                                    <p>The journal encourages authors to share the data and other artefacts supporting the results in the paper by archiving it in an appropriate public repository. Authors should include a data accessibility statement, including a link to the repository they have used, in order that this statement can be published alongside their paper.</p>
